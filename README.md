# C# Mobile Project 2020 
## The Pitch
My app is intended for my father, he works in transport as a truck driver.
He has to keep his trip reports daily and he is currently doing this on paper.
With this app I would like to take away my father's paperwork. 

## Explanation Project

### The applications that this app should contain are:
- Register arrival at a customer (time) and a dropdown menu of which customer.
- Be able to register departure with this customer.
- Record the working time for how long has the user been with the customer.
- Indicate the number of pallets and save them.


  (All this is repeated with every customer and every journey.)


### When the delivery has been made to all customers:
- There must be a possibility to send this trip report to the boss of the company.
