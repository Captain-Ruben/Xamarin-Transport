# C# Mobile Project 2020

## First Project  
This app, created using Xamarin, is one of the first projects I built early in my career.

## The Pitch  
The app was designed with my father in mind, who works as a truck driver in the transport industry. He currently records his trip reports on paper. With this app, my goal is to simplify and eliminate the need for paper-based reports.

## Project Overview

### Core Features of the App:
- **Arrival Registration:** Track arrival time at each customer with a dropdown menu for selecting the customer.
- **Departure Registration:** Log the departure time for each customer.
- **Work Time Tracker:** Record the amount of time spent with each customer.
- **Pallet Count:** Keep track of the number of pallets delivered, and save this data.
  
  (This process is repeated for every customer and each trip.)

### Post-Delivery Functionality:
- After all deliveries are completed, the app allows the user to send a trip report directly to the company boss.
